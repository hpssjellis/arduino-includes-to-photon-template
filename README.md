Instructions
----


1. After forking this repo, go to settings and rename it


1. Copy your arduino .h and .cpp files to the firmware directory


1. Copy your arduino .ino (or rename the .cpp) example program to the examples directory. Best to have a beginner.ino file that only uses the D7 LED, and an advanced.ino file that uses all the capabilities of the ported arduino include with serial.print commands

1. Look at the beginner-hints.md and advanced-hints.md files

Note: I suggest using triple comments /// to edit and comment your include files, that way if anyone tries to help you they can tell the difference between what you have done and what was in the original files.
